# I2C_EEPROM

Arduino Library for external I2C EEPROM - 24LC256, 24LC64

## Description

Library to access external I2C EEPROM. 

The interface is pretty straightforward

- **begin()** constructor
- **begin(sda, scl)** constructor for ESP32
- **writeByte(address, value)** write a single byte
- **writeBlock(address, buffer, length)** 
- **setBlock(address, value, length)** e.g. use to clear I2C EEPROM
- **readByte(address)** - read a single byte from a given address
- **readBlock(address, buffer, length)**
- **updateByte(address, value)** write a single byte, but only if changed.
- **determineSize()**

The **I2C_eeprom_cyclic_store** interface is documented [here](README_cyclic_store.md)

## Limitation

The library does not offer multiple EEPROMS as one 
continuous storage device.

## Operational
